# Simple-system-monitor
<p>Simple system monitor for Linux with GUI written in C++ + Qt</p>
<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>qmake && make</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/onyazuka/Simple-system-monitor/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT</a></p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>I'm planning to develop the project in multiplatform way. That's why despite the fact that it is NOW only for Linux, other platforms may be added. That's why you will not find here any Linux specific information: it is simply no point to add this stuff.</p>
<p>Also, I will seek for ways to add different hardware information.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the project, your contributions and issues reports are welcomed!</p>
