# Simple-system-monitor
<p>Simple system monitor for Linux with GUI written in C++ + Qt</p>
<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>qmake && make</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/onyazuka/Simple-system-monitor/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT</a></p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>If I ever return to this project, I will try to add some other platforms, or just Windows, for beginning. That's why this system monitor doesn't have such Linux specific information, as inodes, etc etc.</p>
<p>Also, maybe it would be good to add some hardware information - CPU core's temperatures, HDD health data and so on.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the project, your contributions and issues reports are welcomed!</p>
